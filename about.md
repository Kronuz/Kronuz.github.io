I'm German M. Bravo (Kronuz), a Software Engineer from Mexico. I work at
[deipi.com](http://www.deipi.com/), a company based in San Diego, California
specializing in online marketing and social network development. I work there as
an Architecture Engineer. My languages of choice are Python and C++, and I'm
fluent in C and Javascript as well. See GitHub for some of my side-projects. I
live in Morelia, Mexico.
